Revision history for Perl extension Statistics::Gap.

0.01  Tue Jun  7 10:45:58 2005
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-XAn Statistics::Gap

0.02  Wed Jul 13 2005
	- Optimized the module by removing the calculation of
	  distance between vectors from the loop and instead
	  pre-computing all possible unique pairwise distances. 

0.03  Sat Aug 13 2005
	- Modified the reference distribution generation 
	  method.	

0.04  Sat Aug 20 2005
	- Some bug fixes: Removed unnecessary division by 2 in the calculation of Dr
	- Added log file to the set of output files.
	- Added confidence interval calculation
	- Updated documentation

0.05  Mon Aug 22 2005
	- Corrected the *.t files
	
0.06  Fri Feb 24 2006
	- Added support for sparse format of the input matrix.
	- Instead of generating B reference distributions - 
      corrected the code to generate just one reference 
      distribution and then sample B replicates from this 
      reference distribution using Monte Carlo Sampling.
	- Corrected a bug - vector distances computed from 
      observed distribution were getting used as vector 
      distances for reference distribution too.

0.08  Wed Apr 26 2006
	- Instead of within cluster dispersion measure (W(k)) 
      this release uses clustering criterion functions (crfun).
    - Uses Algorithm::RandomMatrixGeneration (v0.02) for
      random matrix generation while holding row and column
      marginals fixed.
    - Instead of generating *.png files now provides the data
      required for plot generation in *.dat files.
    - Supports both, vector space and similiarity space.

0.09 Fri Apr 28 2006
	- Corrected a bug (about column index)
	- Instead of 4 plot files (*.dat) now only 3 plot files are created - removed a redundant file. Also renamed the files.
	
0.10 Sat Apr 29 2006
    - Corrected the test files.
