NAME
    Statistics::Gap - Perl extension for the "Gap Statistics"

SYNOPSIS
      use Statistics::Gap;
      &gap("GapPrefix", "Filename.txt", "manhattan", "agglo", 5, 3);

DESCRIPTION
        Given a dataset how does one automatically find the optimal number 
        of clusters that the dataset should be grouped into? - is one of the 
        prevailing problems. Statisticians Robert Tibshirani, Guenther Walther 
        and Trevor Hastie  propose a solution for this problem is a Techinal 
        Report named - "Estimating the number of clusters in a dataset via 
        the Gap Statistics". This perl module implements the approach proposed 
        in the above paper.

EXPORT
     "gap" function by default.

INPUT
  Prefix
        The string that should be used to as a prefix while naming the 
        intermediate files and the .png files (graph files).

  InputFile
        The input dataset is expected in a plain text file where the first
        line in the file gives the dimensions of the dataset and then the 
        dataset in a matrix format should follow. The contexts / observations 
        should be along the rows and the features should be along the column.

   DistanceMeasure
        The Distance Measure that should be used.
        Currrently this module supports the following distance measure:
        1. Manhattan (string that should be used as an argument: "manhattan")
        2. Euclidean (string that should be used as an argument: "euclidean")
        3. Squared Euclidean (string that should be used as an argument: "squared")

   ClusteringAlgorithm
        The Clustering Measures that can be used are:
        1. rb - Repeated Bisections [Default]
        2. rbr - Repeated Bisections for by k-way refinement
        3. direct - Direct k-way clustering
        4. agglo  - Agglomerative clustering
        5. graph  - Graph partitioning-based clustering
        6. bagglo - Partitional biased Agglomerative clustering

   K value
        This is an approximate upper bound for the number of clusters that may be
        present in the dataset. Thus for a dataset that you expect to be seperated
        into 3 clusters this value should be set some integer value greater than 3.

   B value
        Specifies the number of time the reference distribution should be generated
        Typical value would be 3.

OUTPUT
        The output returned is a single integer value which indicates the optimal
        number of clusters that the input dataset should be clustered into.

PRE-REQUISITES
        This module uses suite of C programs called CLUTO for clustering purposes. 
        Thus CLUTO needs to be installed for this module to be functional.
        CLUTO can be downloaded from http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~karypis/cluto/
